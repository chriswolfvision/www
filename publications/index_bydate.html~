		We present a new method for blind document bleed through removal based on separate Markov Random Field (MRF) regularization for the recto and for the verso side, where separate priors are derived from the full graph. The segmentation algorithm is based on Bayesian Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation. The advantages of this separate approach are the adaptation of the prior to the contents creation process (e.g. superimposing two hand written pages), and the improvement of the estimation of the recto pixels through an estimation of the verso pixels covered by recto pixels; Moreover, the formulation as a binary labeling problem with two hidden labels per pixels naturally leads to an efficient optimization method based on the minimum cut/maximum flow in a graph. The proposed method is evaluated on scanned document images from the 18th century, showing an improvement of character recognition results compared to other restoration methods.

		We introduce a new causal hierarchical belief network for image segmentation. Contrary to classical tree structured (or pyramidal) models, the factor graph of the network contains cycles. Each level of the hierarchical structure features the same number of sites as the base level and each site on a given level has several neighbors on the parent level. Compared to tree structured models, the (spatial) random process on the base level of the model is stationary which avoids known drawbacks, namely visual artifacts in the segmented image. 
		We propose different parameterizations of the conditional probability distributions governing the transitions between the image levels. A parametric distribution depending on a single parameter allows the design of a fast inference algorithm on graph cuts, whereas for arbitrary distributions, we propose inference with loopy belief propagation. The method is evaluated on scanned documents, showing an improvement of character recognition results compared to other methods.

			GMM based algorithms have become the de facto standard for background subtraction in video sequences, mainly because of their ability to track multiple background distributions, which allows them to handle complex scenes including moving trees, flags moving in the wind etc. However, it is not always easy to determine which distributions of the mixture belong to the background and which distributions belong to the foreground, which disturbs the results of the labeling process for each pixel. In this work we tackle this problem by taking the labeling decision together for all pixels of several consecutive frames minimizing a global energy function taking into account spatial and temporal relationships. A discrete approximative optical-flow like motion model is integrated into the energy function and solved with Ishikawa's convex graph cuts algorithm.

			Existing action recognition approaches mainly rely on the discriminative power of individual local descriptors extracted from spatio-temporal interest points (STIP), while the geometric relationships among the local features are ignored. This paper presents new features, called pairwise features (PWF), which encode both the appearance and the spatio-temporal relations of the local features for action recognition. First STIPs are extracted, then PWFs are constructed by grouping pairs of STIPs which are both close in space and close in time. We propose a combination of two codebooks for video representation. Experiments on two standard human action datasets: the KTH dataset and the Weizmann dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms most existing methods.

			In this paper we tackle the problem of detecting individual human actions in video sequences. While the most successful methods are based on local features, which proved that they can deal with changes in background, scale and illumination, most existing methods have two main shortcomings: first, they are mainly based on the individual power of spatio-temporal interest points (STIP), and therefore ignore the spatio-temporal relationships between them. Second, these methods mainly focus on direct classification techniques to classify the human activities, as opposed to detection and localization. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach, which is based on a graph matching algorithm for activity recognition. In contrast to most previous methods which classify entire video sequences, we design a video matching method from two sets of ST-points for human activity recognition. First, points are extracted, and a hyper graphs are constructed from them, i.e. graphs with edges involving more than 2 nodes (3 in our case). The activity recognition problem is then transformed into a problem of finding instances of model graphs in the scene graph. By matching local features instead of classifying entire sequences, our method is able to detect multiple different activities which occur simultaneously in a video sequence. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable to the existing techniques on classification, and that it can, additionally, detect and localize activities.

	We propose a novel, interactive content-aware zooming operator that allows effective and efficient visualization of high resolution images on small screens, which may have different aspect ratios compared to the input images. Our approach applies an image retargeting method in order to fit an entire image into the limited screen space. This can provide global, but approximate views for lower zoom levels. However, as we zoom more closely into the image, we continuously unroll the distortion to provide local, but more detailed and accurate views for higher zoom levels. In addition, we propose to use an adaptive view-dependent mesh to achieve high retargeting quality, while maintaining interactive performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed operator by comparing it against the traditional zooming approach, and a method stemming from a direct combination of existing works.

			In this paper, we propose a novel approach for action classification in soccer videos using a recurrent neural network scheme. Thereby, we extract from each video action at each timestep a set of features which describe both the visual content (by the mean of a BoW approach) and the dominant motion (with a key point based approach). A Long Short-Term Memory-based Recurrent Neural Network is then trained to classify each video sequence considering the temporal evolution of the features for each timestep. Experimental results on the MICC-Soccer-Actions-4 database show that the proposed approach outperforms classification methods of related works (with a classification rate of 77 %), and that the combination of the two features (BoW and dominant motion) leads to a classification rate of 92 %.

	In this paper we present a new approach to detect and recognize 3D models in 2D storyboards which have been drawn during the production process of animated cartoons. Our method is robust to occlusion, scale and rotation. The lack of texture and color makes it difficult to extract local features of the target object from the sketched storyboard. Therefore the existing approaches using local descriptors like interest points can fail in such images.  We propose a new framework which combines patch-based Zernike descriptors with a method enforcing spatial constraints for exactly detecting 3D models represented as a set of 2D views in the storyboards. Experimental results show that the proposed method can deal with partial object occlusion and is suitable for poorly textured objects.

			We present a global mesh optimization framework based on a Conditional Markov Random Fied (CMRF or CRF) model suited for 3D triangular meshes of arbitrary topology. The remeshing task is formulated as a Bayesian estimation problem including data attached terms measuring the fidelity to the original mesh as well as a prior favoring high quality triangles. Since the best solution for vertex relocation is strongly related to the mesh connectivity, our approach iteratively modifies the mesh structure (connectivity plus vertex addition/removal) as well as the vertex positions, which are moved according to a well-defined energy function resulting from the CMRF model. Good solutions for the proposed model are obtained by a discrete graph cut algorithm examining global combinations of local candidates. Results on various 3D meshes compare favorably to recent state-of-the-art algorithms regarding the trade-off between triangle shape improvement and surface fidelity. Applications of this work mainly consist in regularizing meshes for numerical simulations and for improving mesh rendering.

    Abstract
Mesh analysis and clustering have became important issues in order to improve the efficiency of common processing
operations like compression, watermarking or simplification. In this context we present a new method for
clustering / labeling a 3D mesh given any field of scalar values associated with its vertices (curvature, density,
roughness etc.). Our algorithm is based on Markov Random Fields, graphical probabilistic models. This Bayesian
framework allows (1) to integrate both the attributes and the geometry in the clustering, and (2) to obtain an optimal
global solution using only local interactions, du to the Markov property of the random field. We have defined
new observation and prior models for 3D meshes, adapted from image processing which achieve very good results
in terms of spatial coherency of the labeling. All model parameters are estimated, resulting in a fully automatic
process (the only required parameter is the number of clusters) which works in reasonable time (several seconds).

		<div class="t-abstract">
		This paper describes the robust reading competitions for ICDAR 2003. With the rapid 
		growth in research over the last few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, 
		there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets, and
		gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term robust 
		reading to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current 
		commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into 
		three sub-problems, and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for 
		the best overall system. The sub-problems we chose were text locating, character 
		recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped 
		to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the sub-problems. 
		Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each 
		algorithm to each image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study in depth the 
		strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text locating contest was the only 
		one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry, and present the 
		results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. 
		We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text 
		locaters, and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual 
		systems.

		A framework for parameterization in computer vision algorithms is evaluated by

		preposed by Wolf et al. The Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used for generalization,

		Binarization techniques have been developed in the document analysis community for 
		over 30 years and many algorithms have been used successfully. On the other hand, 
		document analysis tasks are more and more frequently being applied to multimedia 
		documents such as video sequences. Due to low resolution and lossy compression, the 
		binarization of text included in the frames is a non trivial task. Existing
		techniques work without a model of the spatial relationships in the image, which 
		makes them less powerful. We introduce a new technique based on a Markov Random 
		Field (MRF) model of the document. The model parameters (clique potentials) are 
		learned from training data and the binary image is estimated in a Bayesian
